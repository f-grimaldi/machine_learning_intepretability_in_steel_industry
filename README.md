# Interpretability Methods for Machine Learning algorithms trained on Steel Industry data 

### TODO

### 1. Data overview
    
- **Data Source**: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/severstal-steel-defect-detection/overview) <br>
- **Company**: Severstal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severstal; https://www.severstal.com/eng/about/) <br>
- **Data Description**: Images of dimension 3 x 1600 x 256, with informations about the presence of the defect, its type (multiple chips on the surface/Single vertical cracks/Multiple vertical cracks/Multiple large surface patches) and the location of it.
